# Project Overview
- The EcoPower Logistics CRUD RESTful API project, created in Visual Studio 2022 using C#, 
  showcases an effective API solution for managing logistics data. 
  This system is intended to simplify the administration of the supply, storage, and transportation of solar energy system components. 
  The project, which is based on REST's guiding principles, incorporates Swagger for interactive API description. 
  For essential CRUD activities (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on resources connected to logistics, the API provides a set of endpoints.
  
# Attributes
- Real-time tracking: Through the use of the API, distinct tracking IDs are created for each order, 
  allowing consumers to get updates in real-time on the progress and location of their shipments as well as other 
  information like customer data and the items they have purchased.

- The Swagger dynamic tool, which creates interactive API documentation automatically, and the API are smoothly integrated. 
  This functionality facilitates effective testing and makes stakeholder contact with the endpoints simpler.
  
- Integration of an Azure database: improves data storage, retrieval, and overall performance by utilizing Azure for database hosting. 
  For effective data administration, the API interfaces with the Azure-hosted database without any issues.
